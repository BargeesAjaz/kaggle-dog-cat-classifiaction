This project shows how to do image classification ,starting from JPEg image files on disk,without leveraging pre-trained weights or a pre-made Keras Application model.I demonstrated the workflow on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs binary classification dataset.I used the image_dataset_from_directory utility to generate the datasets and I used Keras image preprocessing layers for image standardization and data augmentation.It contains PetImages folder which contains two subfolders,Cat and Dog .Each subfolder contains image files for each category.Training dataset contains 9 images ,label 1 is "dog" and label 0 is "cat".Images are in a standard size(180*180) as they are being yielded as contiguous float 32 batches by our dataset .However ,their RGB channel values are in the [0,255] range.I standardize the values to be in the [0,1] by using a Rescaling layer at the start of our model.I build a small version of the Xception network.I haven't particularly tried to optimize the architecture.I started the model with the data_augmentation preprocessor,followed by a Rescaling layer.I included a  Dropout layer before the final classification layer.After this, I trained the model for 3 epochs on the full dataset.
